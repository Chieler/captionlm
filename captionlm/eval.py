"""Score domain-biased captioning against a labeled clip set: term
F-score and WER, with biasing on vs off. Run captionlm/build_eval_set.py
first to populate clip_dir automatically from Earnings-21, or hand-collect
<clip>.wav/<clip>.txt pairs yourself.

Each clip is biased with its own <clip>.terms.txt when present, matching
what cli.py does: one document biases its own audio. The combined term
list passed on the command line is used for F-score scoring, so the
metric's vocabulary stays constant across clips.

WER is reported three ways: overall, and split into B-WER (reference
words on the term list) and U-WER (the rest). Overall WER cannot settle
whether biasing paid, because listed words are a small share of the
words and a gain on them hides under run-to-run noise -- see bias_wer.

Three term metrics, because one number cannot carry all three questions:
F-score says how well listed terms that were spoken came out; the
injection rate says how often a listed term that was NOT spoken got put
in anyway, which F-score has no denominator for; per_term says which
terms are responsible for either. The headline pair is recall against
injection rate -- precision cannot improve under biasing and is a
guardrail, not a score -- and "yield" reduces that pair to one number.
