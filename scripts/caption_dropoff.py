"""Caption every audio file in a drop-off directory, biased by the
document sitting next to it.

This is the product path end to end, in one command: a user has a
recording and the document it is about, and wants an .srt in which the
domain terms are spelled correctly. Pair them by filename --
`standup.m4a` next to `standup.pdf` -- and this extracts the terms,
compiles them into the context graph, and transcribes.

Nothing is trained. The term list becomes a trie at call time, which is
the whole reason CTC-WS was chosen over fine-tuning: the user waits for
transcription only, never for training.

An audio file with no matching document is still transcribed, unbiased,
with a warning -- that is the honest baseline, not a failure.

    A document belongs to a recording when its basename is the recording's, or
    starts with it followed by a separator, so one recording can be biased by
    several documents at once: `standup.m4a` takes `standup.pdf`,
    `standup-notes.txt` and `standup_slides.md`. A document that could match
    two recordings goes to the longer one, so `standup-part2.txt` biases
    `standup-part2.m4a` and not `standup.m4a`.

    A document matching no recording is shared: `glossary.pdf` was dropped in
    to be used, and requiring it to be renamed after the recording is a
    contract nobody keeps. Naming a document after a recording is what scopes
    it to that one recording alone.
